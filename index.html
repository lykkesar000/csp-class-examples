 </table>

    <p>As you can probably tell, Summer and Autumn troupe are my favorite, which is ironic because my favorite season is winter</p>
<p>If your curious about what the cards look like, look up the card name and character name. For example, 'About to bloom muku sakisaka bloomed'
                                                     it should be the first or second picture! (bloomed cards have a + sign by the rarity/ bottom right)</p>
                                                     <p>(if you have read all of this, congrats, you are awesome!</p>
    
<p>and here is my nested list! I didnt really have any ideas. I was going include the A3 one as a list, but I think it works as a table better</p>
                                                     <ol Type="A">
<li>My favorite colors
<ol type="1">
<li>Purple/green</li>
<li>dark blue</li>
    <li>Red</li>
</ol>
<li>Favorite mythical creatures</li>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Dragons and unicorns. that's all.</li>
</ol>
